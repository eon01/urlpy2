Description: 
        
        A library with helper functions to parse URLs, and sanitize and normalize them
        in pure python.
        
        This includes support for escaping, unescaping, cleaning and sorting parameters
        and query strings, and a little more sanitization.
        
        This version is a friendly fork of the upstream url.py from Moz to keep a pure
        Python version around to run on Python 2 and 3 and all OSes.
